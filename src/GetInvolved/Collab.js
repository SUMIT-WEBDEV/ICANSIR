            Our mission is to empower all people to defeat cancer through
            awareness, early detection, patient support and survivor
            empowerment. We cannot do this alone, we believe that strategic
            collaboration is at the heart of the fight against cancer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Strategic collaborations that involve civil society, companies,
            cities, international organisations and agencies, research and
            academic institutions are the strongest ways to help expand
            awareness and support, convert political will into action and
            deliver comprehensive and cohesive solutions. Joining efforts leads
            to powerful action at every level.

            Literally, anyone who wants to commit to a world free of cancer can
            connect and collaborate with us! We believe that good collaborations
            make you think wider, and greater while adding value to life and
            social change in many small yet significant ways.
